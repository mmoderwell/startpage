# startpage

An app that makes it easy to hold a bunch of snippets you copy and paste a lot.

&nbsp;

![New Tab](screen.png "Startpage")

## How to use

Copy the `startpage.html` file the your machine. In your browser settings, change the default home page and startup page to point to that. Unfortunately, Chrome doesn't allow you to replace the New Tab page yet without a 3rd party extension.

## Inspiration
This was just the product of me messing around one afternoon. I wanted to put to use some clean CSS animations and build a nice looking startpage that was functional enough to replace the one Chrome currently has.
